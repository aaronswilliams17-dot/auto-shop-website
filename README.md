# Hometown Tire & Auto Repair — Portfolio Website

## Overview
This project is a responsive, single-page website created as a **portfolio demonstration** for a small, family-owned auto repair shop. The focus of the project is clarity, usability, and realistic small-business design rather than complex features or frameworks.

The site reflects how many real auto repair businesses operate: simple, phone-first, and easy for customers to navigate on mobile devices.

## Project Goals
- Build a realistic small-business website using only HTML and CSS
- Practice clean, readable structure and layout

- Prioritize performance and simplicity
